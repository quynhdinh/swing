# Maximum Area Rectangle With Point Constraints II in Java Swing

This project utilizes Java Swing to visualize a solution to an intriguing algorithmic puzzle inspired by the LeetCode problem [3382: Maximum Area Rectangle With Point Constraints II](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-area-rectangle-with-point-constraints-ii/)

Problem Description

You are given N points and tasked with finding the largest rectangle formed by these points, where:

    The rectangle's vertices must be among the given points.
    No points can lie on the edges.
    The edges must be parallel to the axes.

Motivation

I previously solved this problem in C++ and now aim to visualize the solution using Java Swing. This will allow me to practice my Swing skills while demonstrating the power of segment tree visually.

**Solution**: Before I explain the algorithms for this problem, you should be comfortable with segment tree and its implementation.
